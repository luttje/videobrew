# ðŸ“¼ Videobrew

Create videos using any web technologies (like Svelte, Vue and React) or just plain old HTML, CSS and Javascript. Animate your web page and have Videobrew render it to a video.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

> âš  **This software is under construction. Things may work or not work and possibly different from the documentation.**

1. Install the Command Line Interface `@videobrew/cli` globally:

    ```bash
    $ npm i -g @videobrew/cli
    ```

2. Create a web page that describes the video. We call this your video app. *See [our examples](#examples) for more information.*

3. Serve your video app by either:

    - **Letting Videobrew serve your video app for you** 

      Simply point Videobrew to your video app directory when using the `preview` or `render` commands.

    - **Serving it yourself** 
    
      *Be sure to allow it to be viewed from any origin ([CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)) so the editor can preview your video app.*

4. Open a command prompt in the directory of your video app where your `index.html` is.

5. Preview your video app in the browser @ [`http://localhost:8087`](http://localhost:8087):
  
    ```bash
    $ videobrew preview
    ```

6. Render your video app into an `mp4` file:
  
    ```bash
    $ videobrew render my-video.mp4
    ```
