# ðŸ“¼ Videobrew

Create videos using any web technologies (like Svelte, Vue and React) or just plain old HTML, CSS and Javascript. Animate your web page and have Videobrew render it to a video.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

1. Install the Command Line Interface `@videobrew/cli` globally:

    ```bash
    $ npm i -g @videobrew/cli
    ```

2. Create your video app (a web page that describes the video). *For inspiration check out the [examples](#examples).*

3. Preview your video app in the browser by running (in your video app's directory):
  
    ```bash
    $ videobrew preview 
    # Serves the editor @ http://localhost:8087
    # (your video app will also be served for you)
    ```

4. Render your video app into an `mp4` file:
  
    ```bash
    $ videobrew render my-video.mp4
    ```

### (Bonus) Serving your video app yourself

In the [Quickstart](#quickstart) we let Videobrew server your video app for you. But you can also serve it yourself.

If your served video app is running at `http://localhost:8080` then you can preview and render your video app by running these respective commands:

```bash
$ videobrew preview http://localhost:8080

$ videobrew render http://localhost:8080
```

Just make sure your server has [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) configured so the editor can access your video app. To do so set these headers for all requests:
  - `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` 
  - `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin`
