# @75lb/deep-merge

Deep-merge the values of one object structure into another. Similar to [`Object.assign()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) except it processes the full depth of the object structure, not only the top level. Useful for merging config.

## Synopsis

```js
import deepMerge from '@75lb/deep-merge'

```

### Simple

Typical example merging four objects. Input:

```js
deepMerge(
  { port: 8000, data: { animal: 'cow' } },
  { stack: ['one'] },
  { stack: ['two'], help: true },
  { data: { animal: 'bat', metal: 'iron' } }
)
```

Result

```js
{
  port: 8000,
  stack: ['two'],
  help: true,
  data: { animal: 'bat', metal: 'iron' }
}
```

### Arrays

Empty arrays are ignored and not merged in. Input:

```js
deepMerge(
  { stack: ['one'] },
  { stack: [] }
)
```

Result:


```js
{ stack: ['one'] }
```

However, if the later array contains one or more values the later array will *replace* the original: 

```js
deepMerge(
  { stack: ['one'] },
  { stack: ['two'] }
)
```

Result:

```js
{ stack: ['two'] }
```

### Load anywhere

This library is compatible with Node.js, the Web and any style of module loader. It can be loaded anywhere, natively without transpilation.

Within a Node.js ECMAScript Module:

```js
import deepMerge from '@75lb/deep-merge'
```

Within an modern browser ECMAScript Module:

```js
import deepMerge from './node_modules/@75lb/deep-merge/dist/index.mjs'
```

# @rollup/plugin-json

🍣 A Rollup plugin which Converts .json files to ES6 modules.

## Requirements

This plugin requires an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v14.0.0+) and Rollup v1.20.0+.

## Install

Using npm:

```console
npm install @rollup/plugin-json --save-dev
```

## Usage

Create a `rollup.config.js` [configuration file](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#configuration-files) and import the plugin:

```js
import json from '@rollup/plugin-json';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: {
    dir: 'output',
    format: 'cjs'
  },
  plugins: [json()]
};
```

Then call `rollup` either via the [CLI](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#command-line-reference) or the [API](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#javascript-api).

With an accompanying file `src/index.js`, the local `package.json` file would now be importable as seen below:

```js
// src/index.js
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';

const pkg = JSON.parse(readFileSync(new URL('./package.json', import.meta.url), 'utf8'));
console.log(`running version ${pkg.version}`);
```

## Options

### `compact`

Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

If `true`, instructs the plugin to ignore `indent` and generates the smallest code.

### `exclude`

Type: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>
Default: `null`

A [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should _ignore_. By default no files are ignored.

### `include`

Type: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>
Default: `null`

A [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should operate on. By default all files are targeted.

### `indent`

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `'\t'`

Specifies the indentation for the generated default export.

### `namedExports`

Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

If `true`, instructs the plugin to generate a named export for every property of the JSON object.

### `preferConst`

Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

If `true`, instructs the plugin to declare properties as variables, using either `var` or `const`. This pertains to tree-shaking.

# @rollup/pluginutils

A set of utility functions commonly used by 🍣 Rollup plugins.

## Requirements

The plugin utils require an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v14.0.0+) and Rollup v1.20.0+.

## Install

Using npm:

```console
npm install @rollup/pluginutils --save-dev
```

## Usage

```js
import utils from '@rollup/pluginutils';
//...
```

## API

Available utility functions are listed below:

_Note: Parameter names immediately followed by a `?` indicate that the parameter is optional._

### addExtension

Adds an extension to a module ID if one does not exist.

Parameters: `(filename: String, ext?: String)`<br>
Returns: `String`

```js
import { addExtension } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  return {
    resolveId(code, id) {
      // only adds an extension if there isn't one already
      id = addExtension(id); // `foo` -> `foo.js`, `foo.js` -> `foo.js`
      id = addExtension(id, '.myext'); // `foo` -> `foo.myext`, `foo.js` -> `foo.js`
    }
  };
}
```

### attachScopes

Attaches `Scope` objects to the relevant nodes of an AST. Each `Scope` object has a `scope.contains(name)` method that returns `true` if a given name is defined in the current scope or a parent scope.

Parameters: `(ast: Node, propertyName?: String)`<br>
Returns: `Object`

See [rollup-plugin-inject](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-inject) or [rollup-plugin-commonjs](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs) for an example of usage.

```js
import { attachScopes } from '@rollup/pluginutils';
import { walk } from 'estree-walker';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  return {
    transform(code) {
      const ast = this.parse(code);

      let scope = attachScopes(ast, 'scope');

      walk(ast, {
        enter(node) {
          if (node.scope) scope = node.scope;

          if (!scope.contains('foo')) {
            // `foo` is not defined, so if we encounter it,
            // we assume it's a global
          }
        },
        leave(node) {
          if (node.scope) scope = scope.parent;
        }
      });
    }
  };
}
```

### createFilter

Constructs a filter function which can be used to determine whether or not certain modules should be operated upon.

Parameters: `(include?: <picomatch>, exclude?: <picomatch>, options?: Object)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### `include` and `exclude`

Type: `String | RegExp | Array[...String|RegExp]`<br>

A valid [`picomatch`](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#globbing-features) pattern, or array of patterns. If `options.include` is omitted or has zero length, filter will return `true` by default. Otherwise, an ID must match one or more of the `picomatch` patterns, and must not match any of the `options.exclude` patterns.

Note that `picomatch` patterns are very similar to [`minimatch`](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#readme) patterns, and in most use cases, they are interchangeable. If you have more specific pattern matching needs, you can view [this comparison table](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#library-comparisons) to learn more about where the libraries differ.

#### `options`

##### `resolve`

Type: `String | Boolean | null`

Optionally resolves the patterns against a directory other than `process.cwd()`. If a `String` is specified, then the value will be used as the base directory. Relative paths will be resolved against `process.cwd()` first. If `false`, then the patterns will not be resolved against any directory. This can be useful if you want to create a filter for virtual module names.

#### Usage

```js
import { createFilter } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  // assume that the myPlugin accepts options of `options.include` and `options.exclude`
  var filter = createFilter(options.include, options.exclude, {
    resolve: '/my/base/dir'
  });

  return {
    transform(code, id) {
      if (!filter(id)) return;

      // proceed with the transformation...
    }
  };
}
```

### dataToEsm

Transforms objects into tree-shakable ES Module imports.

Parameters: `(data: Object)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### `data`

Type: `Object`

An object to transform into an ES module.

#### Usage

```js
import { dataToEsm } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

const esModuleSource = dataToEsm(
  {
    custom: 'data',
    to: ['treeshake']
  },
  {
    compact: false,
    indent: '\t',
    preferConst: false,
    objectShorthand: false,
    namedExports: true
  }
);
/*
Outputs the string ES module source:
  export const custom = 'data';
  export const to = ['treeshake'];
  export default { custom, to };
*/
```

### extractAssignedNames

Extracts the names of all assignment targets based upon specified patterns.

Parameters: `(param: Node)`<br>
Returns: `Array[...String]`

#### `param`

Type: `Node`

An `acorn` AST Node.

#### Usage

```js
import { extractAssignedNames } from '@rollup/pluginutils';
import { walk } from 'estree-walker';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  return {
    transform(code) {
      const ast = this.parse(code);

      walk(ast, {
        enter(node) {
          if (node.type === 'VariableDeclarator') {
            const declaredNames = extractAssignedNames(node.id);
            // do something with the declared names
            // e.g. for `const {x, y: z} = ...` => declaredNames = ['x', 'z']
          }
        }
      });
    }
  };
}
```

### makeLegalIdentifier

Constructs a bundle-safe identifier from a `String`.

Parameters: `(str: String)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### Usage

```js
import { makeLegalIdentifier } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

makeLegalIdentifier('foo-bar'); // 'foo_bar'
makeLegalIdentifier('typeof'); // '_typeof'
```

### normalizePath

Converts path separators to forward slash.

Parameters: `(filename: String)`<br>

agent-base 6.0.2

agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etc…
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
     for the public:

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

[download-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/co-body

  Parse request bodies with generators inspired by [Raynos/body](https://github.com/Raynos/body).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install co-body
```

## Options

  - `limit` number or string representing the request size limit (1mb for json and 56kb for form-urlencoded)
  - `strict` when set to `true`, JSON parser will only accept arrays and objects; when `false` will accept anything `JSON.parse` accepts. Defaults to `true`. (also `strict` mode will always return object).
  - `queryString` an object of options when parsing query strings and form data. See [qs](https://github.com/hapijs/qs) for more information.
  - `returnRawBody` when set to `true`, the return value of `co-body` will be an object with two properties: `{ parsed: /* parsed value */, raw: /* raw body */}`.
  - `jsonTypes` is used to determine what media type **co-body** will parse as **json**, this option is passed directly to the [type-is](https://github.com/jshttp/type-is) library.
  - `formTypes` is used to determine what media type **co-body** will parse as **form**, this option is passed directly to the [type-is](https://github.com/jshttp/type-is) library.
  - `textTypes` is used to determine what media type **co-body** will parse as **text**, this option is passed directly to the [type-is](https://github.com/jshttp/type-is) library.

more options available via [raw-body](https://github.com/stream-utils/raw-body#getrawbodystream-options-callback):

## Example

```js
// application/json
var body = await parse.json(req);

// explicit limit
var body = await parse.json(req, { limit: '10kb' });

// application/x-www-form-urlencoded
var body = await parse.form(req);

// text/plain
var body = await parse.text(req);

// either
var body = await parse(req);

// custom type
var body = await parse(req, { textTypes: ['text', 'html'] });
```

## Koa

  This lib also supports `ctx.req` in Koa (or other libraries),
  so that you may simply use `this` instead of `this.req`.

```js
// application/json
var body = await parse.json(this);

// application/x-www-form-urlencoded
var body = await parse.form(this);

// text/plain
var body = await parse.text(this);

// either
var body = await parse(this);
```

copy-to 2.0.1
MIT
copy-to
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/node-modules/copy-to.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/node-modules/copy-to)

copy an object's properties to another one, include propertiy, getter and setter.

## Install

```
npm install copy-to
```

## Usage

```js
copy(src).to(des);
copy(src).toCover(des);
copy(src).override(des);

copy(src).pick('proName1', 'proName2').to(des);
copy(src).pick('proName1', 'proName2').toCover(des);
copy(src).pick('proName1', 'proName2').override(des);

copy(src).and(other).to(des);
copy(src).and(other).toCover(des);
copy(src).and(second).and(third).to(des);

copy(src).and(other).pick('proName1', 'proName2').to(des);
copy(src).and(other).pick('proName1', 'proName2').toCover(des);
copy(src).and(second).and(third).pick('proName1', 'proName2').to(des);
```

It won't copy access(getter / setter) by default, if you want to copy them, please use:

```js
copy(src).withAccess().and(other).to(des);
```

## Example

```js
var copy = require('copy-to');

var src = {
  _name: 'foo',
  set name(val) {
    this._name = val;
  },
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  },
  show: function () {
    console.log(this._name);
  }
};

var des = {
  _name: 'bar'
};

copy(src).to(des);
copy(src).toCover(des);
copy(src).pick('_name', 'name').to(des);
copy(src).pick('_name', 'name').toCover(des);
```

# `dlv(obj, keypath)` [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dlv.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/dlv) [![Build](https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv)

> Safely get a dot-notated path within a nested object, with ability to return a default if the full key path does not exist or the value is undefined


### Why?

Smallest possible implementation: only **130 bytes.**

You could write this yourself, but then you'd have to write [tests].

Supports ES Modules, CommonJS and globals.


### Installation

`npm install --save dlv`


### Usage

`delve(object, keypath, [default])`

```js
import delve from 'dlv';

let obj = {
	a: {
		b: {
			c: 1,
			d: undefined,
			e: null
		}
	}
};

//use string dot notation for keys
delve(obj, 'a.b.c') === 1;

//or use an array key
delve(obj, ['a', 'b', 'c']) === 1;

delve(obj, 'a.b') === obj.a.b;

//returns undefined if the full key path does not exist and no default is specified
delve(obj, 'a.b.f') === undefined;

//optional third parameter for default if the full key in path is missing
delve(obj, 'a.b.f', 'foo') === 'foo';

//or if the key exists but the value is undefined
delve(obj, 'a.b.d', 'foo') === 'foo';

//Non-truthy defined values are still returned if they exist at the full keypath
delve(obj, 'a.b.e', 'foo') === null;

### Setter Counterparts

- [dset](https://github.com/lukeed/dset) by [@lukeed](https://github.com/lukeed) is the spiritual "set" counterpart of `dlv` and very fast.
- [bury](https://github.com/kalmbach/bury) by [@kalmbach](https://github.com/kalmbach) does the opposite of `dlv` and is implemented in a very similar manner.

http-proxy-agent 4.0.1
MIT
http-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http` module.

__Note:__ For HTTP proxy usage with the `https` module, check out
[`node-https-proxy-agent`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent).

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install http-proxy-agent
```


Example
-------

``` js
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var HttpProxyAgent = require('http-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

http.get(opts, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

https-proxy-agent 5.0.1
MIT
https-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;

https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);

var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:

  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

# Is Module

Check whether a source string looks like an ES6 module.
This doesn't actually execute the code,
and doesn't check other module types.
So source strings without any module loaders returns `false`.

This is just what I need from https://github.com/yahoo/js-module-formats, which actually executes the sauce string in a subcontext.

## API

```js
var isES6Module = require('is-module');

console.log(isES6Module('import * from "emitter";')) // => true
```

is-reference 1.2.1
MIT
# is-reference

Utility for determining whether an AST node is a reference.

`foo` is a reference in these cases:

```js
console.log( foo );
var foo;
function foo () {}
function bar ( foo ) {}
export { foo as x };
```

`foo` is *not* a reference in these cases:

```js
var obj = { foo: 1 };
console.log( obj.foo );
export { x as foo };
```

In all cases, `foo` is an `Identifier` node, but the two kinds must be treated differently for the purposes of scope analysis etc. (The examples are non-exhaustive.)


## Installation

```bash
npm install is-reference
```


## Usage

Example using [Acorn](https://github.com/ternjs/acorn) and [estree-walker](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/estree-walker):

```js
const { parse } = require( 'acorn' );
const { walk } = require( 'estree-walker' );
const isReference = require( 'is-reference' );

const identifiers = [];
const references = [];

const ast = parse( `var a = b.c;` );

walk( ast, {
	enter ( node, parent ) {
		if ( node.type === 'Identifier' ) identifiers.push( node );
		if ( isReference( node, parent ) ) references.push( node );
	}
});

identifiers.forEach( node => console.log( node.name ) ); // a, b, c
references.forEach( node => console.log( node.name ) ); // a, b
```

koa-json 2.0.2
MIT

# koa-json

  JSON pretty-printed response middleware.
  Also converts node object streams to binary.

## Installation

```
$ npm install koa-json
```

## Options

 - `pretty` default to pretty response [true]
 - `param` optional query-string param for pretty responses [none]
 - `spaces` JSON spaces [2]

## Example

  Always pretty by default:

```js
var json = require('koa-json');
var Koa = require('koa');
var app = new Koa();

app.use(json());

app.use((ctx) => {
  ctx.body = { foo: 'bar' };
});
```

  yields:

```js
$ GET /

{
  "foo": "bar"
}
```

  Default to being disabled (useful in production), but
  togglable via the query-string parameter:

```js
var Koa = require('koa');
var app = new Koa();

app.use(json({ pretty: false, param: 'pretty' }));

app.use((ctx) => {
  ctx.body = { foo: 'bar' };
});
```

 yields:

```js
$ GET /

{"foo":"bar"}
```

```js
$ GET /?pretty

{
  "foo": "bar"
}
```

### Installation

```sh
$ npm install koa-range
```

### Usage (with koa@2)

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var range = require('koa-range');
var route = require('koa-route');
var Koa = require('koa');
var app = new Koa();

app.use(range);

// via buffer
app.use(route.get('/', async function (ctx) {
  ctx.body = new Buffer(100);
}));

// via object
app.use(route.get('/json', async function (ctx) {
  ctx.body = {
    'foo': 'bar'
  };
}));

// via readable stream
app.use(route.get('/stream', async function (ctx) {
  ctx.body = fs.createReadStream('your path');
}));

```

Until async/await is supported by default, you will need to do one of the following:
- Transpile your code with somehting like Babel
- Use node v7 with --harmony-async-await flag

  tobi: { name: 'tobi', species: 'ferret' },
  loki: { name: 'loki', species: 'ferret' },
  jane: { name: 'jane', species: 'ferret' }
};

var pets = {
  list: (ctx) => {
    var names = Object.keys(db);
    ctx.body = 'pets: ' + names.join(', ');
  },

  show: (ctx, name) => {
    var pet = db[name];
    if (!pet) return ctx.throw('cannot find that pet', 404);
    ctx.body = pet.name + ' is a ' + pet.species;
  }
};

app.use(_.get('/pets', pets.list));
app.use(_.get('/pets/:name', pets.show));

 - `br`  Try to serve the brotli version of a file automatically when brotli is supported by a client and if the requested file with .br extension exists (note, that brotli is only accepted over https). defaults to true.
 - [setHeaders](https://github.com/koajs/send#setheaders) Function to set custom headers on response.
 - `extensions` Try to match extensions from passed array to search for file when no extension is sufficed in URL. First found is served. (defaults to `false`)

## Example

```js
const serve = require('koa-static');
const Koa = require('koa');
const app = new Koa();

// $ GET /package.json
app.use(serve('.'));

// $ GET /hello.txt
app.use(serve('test/fixtures'));

// or use absolute paths
app.use(serve(__dirname + '/test/fixtures'));

app.listen(3000);

console.log('listening on port 3000');
```

      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

sirv 2.0.2
MIT
# sirv ![CI](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

> The optimized and lightweight middleware for serving requests to static assets

You may use `sirv` as a *very* fast and lightweight alternative to [`serve-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static).

The massive performance advantage over `serve-static` is explained by **not** relying on the file system for existence checks on every request. These are expensive interactions and must be avoided whenever possible! Instead, when not in "dev" mode, `sirv` performs all its file-system operations upfront and then relies on its cache for future operations.

This middleware will work out of the box for [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka), Express, and other Express-like frameworks. It will also work with the native `http`, `https` and `http2` modules. It requires _very_ little effort to modify/wrap it for servers that don't accept the `(req, res, next)` signature.

:bulb: For a feature-complete CLI application, check out the sibling [`sirv-cli`](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv-cli) package as an alternative to [`zeit/serve`](https://github.com/zeit/serve)~!

## Install

```
$ npm install --save sirv
```


## Usage

```js
const sirv = require('sirv');
const polka = require('polka');
const compress = require('compression')();

// Init `sirv` handler
const assets = sirv('public', {
  maxAge: 31536000, // 1Y
  immutable: true
});

polka()
  .use(compress, assets)
  .use('/api', require('./api'))
  .listen(3000, err => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('> Ready on localhost:3000~!');
  });
```


## API

### sirv(dir, opts={})

Returns: `Function`

The returned function is a middleware in the standard Express-like signature: `(req, res, next)`, where `req` is the [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), `res` is the [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), and `next` (in this case) is the function to call if no file was found for the given path.

When defined, a `next()` callback is always called _instead of_ the [`opts.onNoMatch`](#optsonnomatch) callback. However, unlike `onNoMatch`, your `next()` is given no arguments.

#### dir
Type: `String`<br>
Default: `.`

The directory from which to read and serve assets. It is resolved to an absolute path &mdash; you must provide an absolute path yourself if `process.cwd()` is not the correct assumption.

#### opts.dev
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Enable "dev" mode, which disables/skips caching. Instead, `sirv` will traverse the file system ***on every request***.

Additionally, `dev` mode will ignore `maxAge` and `immutable` as these options generate a production-oriented `Cache-Control` header value.

> **Important:** Do not use `dev` mode in production!

#### opts.etag
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Generate and attach an `ETag` header to responses.

> **Note:** If an incoming request's [`If-None-Match` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match) matches the `ETag` value, a `304` response is given.

#### opts.dotfiles
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Allow requests to dotfiles (files or directories beginning with a `.`).

> **Note:** Requests to [`/.well-known/*`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615) are always allowed.

#### opts.extensions
Type: `Array<String>`<br>
Default: `['html', 'htm']`

The file extension fallbacks to check for if a pathame is not initially found. For example, if a `/login` request cannot find a `login` filename, it will then look for `login.html` and `login.htm` before giving up~!

> **Important:** Actually, `sirv` will **also** look for `login/index.html` and `login/index.htm` before giving up.

#### opts.gzip
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Determine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.gz` files.<br>
Must be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include "gzip" in order for `sirv` to search for the gzip'd alternative.

> **Note:** The `.gz` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.

```js
// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE
// Showing lookup logic

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] "/foobar.jpg"
lookup([
  '/foobar.jpg.gz', '/foobar.jpg',
  '/foobar.jpg.html.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.gz',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.gz',
  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',
]);

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] "/"
lookup([
  '/index.html.gz',
  '/index.htm.gz',
  '/index.html',
  '/index.htm',
]);
```


#### opts.brotli
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Determine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.br` files.<br>
Must be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include either "br" or "brotli" in order for `sirv` to search for the brotli-compressed alternative.

> **Note:** The `.br` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.

When both `opts.broli` and `opts.gzip` are enabled &mdash; and all conditions are equal &mdash; then the brotli variant always takes priority.

```js
// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE
// Showing lookup logic

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br] "/foobar.jpg"
lookup([
  '/foobar.jpg.br', '/foobar.jpg',
  '/foobar.jpg.html.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.br',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.br',
  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',
]);

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br,gz] "/"
lookup([
  '/index.html.br'
  '/index.htm.br'
  '/index.html.gz'
  '/index.htm.gz'
  '/index.html'
  '/index.htm'
]);
```

#### opts.maxAge
Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Enables the `Cache-Control` header on responses and sets the `max-age` value (in seconds).<br>
For example, `maxAge: 31536000` is equivalent to one year.

#### opts.immutable
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Appends the [`immutable` directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#Revalidation_and_reloading) on your `Cache-Control` header, used for uniquely-named assets that will not change!

> **Important:** Will only work if `opts.maxAge` has a value defined!

#### opts.single
Type: `Boolean` or `String`<br>
Default: `false`

Treat the directory as a single-page application.

When `true`, the directory's index page (default `index.html`) will be sent if the request asset does not exist.<br>
You may pass a `string` value to use a file _instead of_ `index.html` as your fallback.

For example, if "/about" is requested but no variants of that file exist, then the response for "/" is sent instead:

```js
// Note: This is psuedo code to illustrate what's happening

// Request: "/about"
let file = find(['/about', '/about.html', '/about.htm', '/about/index.html', '/about.htm']);
if (file) {
  send(file);
} else if (opts.single === true) {
  file = find(['/', '/index.html', '/index.htm']);
  send(file);
} else if (typeof opts.single === 'string') {
  file = find([opts.single]);
  send(file);
} else {
  // next() or 404
}
```

#### opts.ignores
Type: `false` or `Array<String | RegExp>`

Specify paths/patterns that should ignore the fallback behavior that `opts.single` provides.

By default, any asset-like path (URLs that end with an extension) will be ignored. This means that, for example, if `/foobar.jpg` is not found, a `404` response is sent instead of the `index.html` fallback.

Additionally, any `/.well-known/*` pathname ignores the fallback – as do all other dotfile requests when `opts.dotfiles` is enabled.

Any string value(s) will be passed through `new RegExp(value, 'i')` directly.

Finally, you may set `ignores: false` to disable ***all*** ignores, including the defaults. Put differently, this will fallback ***all*** unknown pathnames to your `index.html` (or custom `opts.single` value).

> **Important:** Only has an effect if `opts.single` is enabled.

#### opts.onNoMatch
Type: `Function`

A custom function to run if a file cannot be found for a given request. <br>By default, `sirv` will send a basic `(404) Not found` response.

The function receives the current `req <IncomingMessage>, res <ServerResponse>` pair for as its two arguments.

> **Note:** This won't run if a `next` callback has been provided to the middleware; see [`sirv`](#sirvdir-opts) description.

#### opts.setHeaders
Type: `Function`

A custom function to append or change any headers on the outgoing response. There is no default.

Its signature is `(res, pathname, stats)`, where `res` is the `ServerResponse`, `pathname` is incoming request path (stripped of queries), and `stats` is the file's result from [`fs.statSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_statsync_path).

sorcery 0.11.0
MIT
# sorcery.js

Sourcemaps are great - if you have a JavaScript file, and you minify it, your minifier can generate a map that lets you debug as though you were looking at the original uncompressed code.

But if you have more than one transformation - say you want to transpile your JavaScript, concatenate several files into one, and minify the result - it gets a little trickier. Each intermediate step needs to be able to both *ingest* a sourcemap and *generate* one, all the time pointing back to the original source.

Most compilers don't do that. ([UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) is an honourable exception.) So when you fire up devtools, instead of looking at the original source you find yourself looking at the final intermediate step in the chain of transformations.

**Sorcery aims to fix that.** Given an file at the end of a transformation chain (e.g., your minified JavaScript), it will follow the entire chain back to the original source, and generate a new sourcemap that describes the whole process. How? Magic.

This is a work-in-progress - suitable for playing around with, but don't rely on it to debug air traffic control software or medical equipment. Other than that, it can't do much harm.


## Usage

### As a node module

Install sorcery locally:

```bash
npm install sorcery
```

```js
var sorcery = require( 'sorcery' );

sorcery.load( 'some/generated/code.min.js' ).then( function ( chain ) {
  // generate a flattened sourcemap
  var map = chain.apply(); // { version: 3, file: 'code.min.js', ... }

  // get a JSON representation of the sourcemap
  map.toString(); // '{"version":3,"file":"code.min.js",...}'

  // get a data URI representation
  map.toUrl(); // 'data:application/json;charset=utf-8;base64,eyJ2ZXJ...'

  // write to a new file - this will create `output.js` and
  // `output.js.map`, and will preserve relative paths. It
  // returns a Promise
  chain.write( 'output.js' );

  // write to a new file but use an absolute path for the
  // sourceMappingURL
  chain.write( 'output.js', { absolutePath: true });

  // write to a new file, but append the flattened sourcemap as a data URI
  chain.write( 'output.js', { inline: true });

  // overwrite the existing file
  chain.write();
  chain.write({ inline: true });

  // find the origin of line x, column y. Returns an object with
  // `source`, `line`, `column` and (if applicable) `name` properties.
  // Note - for consistency with other tools, line numbers are always
  // one-based, column numbers are always zero-based. It's daft, I know.
  var loc = chain.trace( x, y );
});

// You can also use sorcery synchronously:
var chain = sorcery.loadSync( 'some/generated/code.min.js' );
var map = chain.apply();
var loc = chain.trace( x, y );
chain.writeSync();
```

#### Advanced options

You can pass an optional second argument to `sorcery.load()` and `sorcery.loadSync()`, with zero or more of the following properties:

* `content` - a map of `filename: contents` pairs. `filename` will be resolved against the current working directory if needs be
* `sourcemaps` - a map of `filename: sourcemap` pairs, where `filename` is the name of the file the sourcemap is related to. This will override any `sourceMappingURL` comments in the file itself.

For example:

```js
sorcery.load( 'some/generated/code.min.js', {
  content: {
    'some/minified/code.min.js': '...',
    'some/transpiled/code.js': '...',
    'some/original/code.js': '...'
  },
  sourcemaps: {
    'some/minified/code.min.js': {...},
    'some/transpiled/code.js': {...}
  }
}).then( chain => {
  /* ... */
});
```

Any files not found will be read from the filesystem as normal.

### On the command line

First, install sorcery globally:

```bash
npm install -g sorcery
```

```
Usage:
  sorcery [options]

Options:
  -h, --help               Show help message
  -v, --version            Show version
  -i, --input <file>       Input file
  -o, --output <file>      Output file (if absent, will overwrite input)
  -d, --datauri            Append map as a data URI, rather than separate file
  -x, --excludeContent     Don't populate the sourcesContent array
```

Examples:

```bash
# overwrite sourcemap in place (will write map to
# some/generated/code.min.js.map, and update
# sourceMappingURL comment if necessary
sorcery -i some/generated/code.min.js

# append flattened sourcemap as an inline data URI
# (will delete existing .map file, if applicable)
sorcery -d -i some/generated/code.min.js

# write to a new file (will create newfile.js and
# newfile.js.map)
sorcery -i some/generated/code.min.js -o newfile.js
```

| `--no-tsconfig`                                                 | Use this if you only want to check the Svelte files found in the current directory and below and ignore any JS/TS files (they will not be type-checked)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `--ignore <path1,path2>`                                        | Only has an effect when used in conjunction with `--no-tsconfig`. Files/folders to ignore - relative to workspace root, comma-separated, inside quotes. Example: `--ignore "dist,build"`. When used in conjunction with `--tsconfig`, this will only have effect on the files watched, not on the files that are diagnosed, which is then determined by the `tsconfig.json`                 |
| `--fail-on-warnings`                                            | Will also exit with error code when there are warnings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `--compiler-warnings <code1:error\|ignore,code2:error\|ignore>` | A list of Svelte compiler warning codes. Each entry defines whether that warning should be ignored or treated as an error. Warnings are comma-separated, between warning code and error level is a colon; all inside quotes. Example: `--compiler-warnings "css-unused-selector:ignore,unused-export-let:error"`                                                                            |
| `--diagnostic-sources <js,svelte,css>`                          | A list of diagnostic sources which should run diagnostics on your code. Possible values are `js` (includes TS), `svelte`, `css`. Comma-separated, inside quotes. By default all are active. Example: `--diagnostic-sources "js,svelte"`                                                                                                                                                     |
| `--threshold <error\|warning>`                                  | Filters the diagnostics to display. `error` will output only errors while `warning` will output warnings and errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### FAQ

#### Why is there no option to only check specific files (for example only staged files)?

`svelte-check` needs to know the whole project to do valid checks. Imagine you alter a component property `export let foo` to `export let bar`, but you don't update any of the component usages. They all have errors now but you would not catch them if you only run checks on changed files.

### More docs, preprocessor setup and troubleshooting

[See here](/docs/README.md).

### Machine-Readable Output

Setting the `--output` to `machine` will format output in a way that is easier to read
by machines, e.g. inside CI pipelines, for code quality checks, etc.

Each row corresponds to a new record. Rows are made up of columns that are separated by a
single space character. The first column of every row contains a timestamp in milliseconds
which can be used for monitoring purposes. The second column gives us the "row type", based
on which the number and types of subsequent columns may differ.

The first row is of type `START` and contains the workspace folder (wrapped in quotes).

###### Example:

```
1590680325583 START "/home/user/language-tools/packages/language-server/test/plugins/typescript/testfiles"
```

Any number of `ERROR` or `WARNING` records may follow. Their structure is identical and tells
us the filename, the line and column numbers, and the error message. The filename is relative
to the workspace directory. The filename and the message are both wrapped in quotes.

###### Example:

```
1590680326283 ERROR "codeactions.svelte" 1:16 "Cannot find module 'blubb' or its corresponding type declarations."
1590680326778 WARNING "imported-file.svelte" 0:37 "Component has unused export property 'prop'. If it is for external reference only, please consider using `export const prop`"
```

The output concludes with a `COMPLETED` message that summarizes total numbers of files, errors and warnings that were encountered during the check.

###### Example:

```
1590680326807 COMPLETED 20 FILES 21 ERRORS 1 WARNINGS
```

If the application experiences a runtime error, this error will appear as a `FAILURE` record.

###### Example:

```
1590680328921 FAILURE "Connection closed"
```
